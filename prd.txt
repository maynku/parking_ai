1. Introduction
1.1 Overview
The goal of this project is to develop an AI-based system that can detect and count parking spaces using a live video feed from an IP camera or phone. The system will identify occupied and available parking spots in real time and display the count on the screen.
1.2 Scope (MVP Features)
•	Live video feed from an IP camera or phone.
•	Real-time parking space detection using a white A4 sheet with marked parking slots.
•	Matchboxes will represent cars for testing.
•	YOLO (You Only Look Once) for object detection.
•	OpenCV for image processing.
•	Scikit-learn for potential model fine-tuning.
•	Display the total number of parking spaces and the number of occupied spaces.
1.3 Out of Scope
•	No dashboard or database storage.
•	No advanced UI/UX—just a simple display of parking space count.
•	No mobile app integration.
2. Functional Requirements
2.1 Core Features
Feature	Description
Live Video Feed	Capture live video using an IP camera or phone.
Parking Slot Detection	Identify marked parking slots on a white A4 sheet.
Car Detection	Detect matchbox-sized "cars" occupying slots.
Real-time Counting	Display the number of available and occupied slots.
3. Technical Requirements
3.1 Tech Stack
•	Hardware: Phone/IP camera
•	Software & Libraries: 
o	Python
o	OpenCV (for video processing)
o	YOLO (for object detection)
o	Scikit-learn (if needed for additional classification tasks)
3.2 Data Flow
1.	The camera captures a live feed of the parking area (A4 sheet with marked slots).
2.	YOLO detects the parking spaces and the matchbox cars.
3.	OpenCV processes the video frames to track occupancy.
4.	The system counts occupied and available slots.
5.	The final count is displayed on-screen.
4. User Interface
•	A simple screen displaying: 
o	Total Parking Slots: X
o	Occupied Slots: Y
o	Available Slots: Z
5. Constraints & Assumptions
•	The camera angle must remain fixed.
•	Lighting conditions should be stable.
•	Parking slots should be clearly marked.
6. Success Metrics
•	Accuracy of parking slot detection (target: >90%).
•	Real-time performance (<1 sec delay).
•	Stability of the live feed processing.
